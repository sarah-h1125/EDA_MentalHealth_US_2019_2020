<b> Project #1: Exploratory Data Analysis project using MS SQL Server &amp; Tableau Public 
<br> Mental Health in U.S. 2019-2020</b> 

In this project, I combined data from various U.S. government departments including the CDC, HRSA, and NHI to explore trends in mental health among U.S. adults between 2019 and 2020. The data was cleaned, transformed and combined in MS SQL Server, and imported in Tableau Public for visualization.
